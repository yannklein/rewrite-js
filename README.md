# Re-write JS

## An adventure to re-write every JS built-in method and get some knowledge out of it.

### Methods built
##### Array:
- at
- concat
- copyWithin
- each
- map

### TIL so far:
- a function can have more args than it as params in its definition
- jest dummy function practice
- concat can be used on multiple array, or even with objects
- an array can have an empty value that is slighlty distinct from undefined (sparse array)
- Iterators are not global object in JS
